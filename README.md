# delete-your-ex
This project is a web application that uses facial detection to overlay emojis on the faces of a selected individual in a collection of photos uploaded by the user. The goal is for the user to hide the face of an ex-partner/friend with a negatively connotated emoji (or to hide the face of a new love with a positively connotated emoji for a 'soft launch'). The key features include:

A user interface that allows users to upload photos from their device.
Allows for users to select the emoji they want to overlay on a selected individual.
Uses facial recognition algorithms to recognize the infividual's face.

## Installation:
